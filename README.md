## Purpose

This is my fifth game that I built while learning Unity. It's very simple, but it's actually looking like a real game!

For this game, I learned how screenshake, singletons, background music, background image scrolling, and UI elements work. Notably, some things that didn't work in my Quiz Master game worked in this game, so I learned those elements properly here.

Bookmark my page to stay notified of upcoming games as I continue to learn about Unity and game development!
